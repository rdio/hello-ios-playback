A Simple Playback Example For iOS
=================================

This example application demonstrates how to do simple playback and authentication with the Rdio iOS SDK.

To use this, you'll need to head over to https://rdio.com/developers/, create an OAuth 2.0 application,
and put your `client_id` and `client_secret` into `Hello/ClientCredentials.h`.

See [`Hello/ClientCredentials_EXAMPLE.h`](https://github.com/rdio/hello-ios-playback/blob/master/Hello/ClientCredentials_EXAMPLE.h)
for an example of what that file should look like.


### More advanced usage
