/** @mainpage
 * The Rdio iOS SDK lets developers call the web service API, authenticate users,
 * and play full song streams or 30 second samples.
 * <br/><br/>
 * To get started:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Visit http://www.rdio.com/developers/ to register a developer account and apply for a key</li>
 *  <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/rdio/rdioquiz-ios">sample app</a></li>
 *  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.rdio.com/media/static/developer/ios/rdio-ios.tar.gz">framework</a></li>
 *  <li>Drag the Rdio framework into your XCode project</li>
 *  <li><b>Add the following frameworks to your project:</b>
 *    <ul>
 *      <li>CoreGraphics</li>
 *      <li>CFNetwork</li>
 *      <li>CoreMedia</li>
 *      <li>SystemConfiguration</li>
 *      <li>AudioToolbox</li>
 *      <li>Security</li>
 *    </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li><b>Add <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1490/_index.html">-all_load</a> under Other Linker Flags in the project build info</b></li>
 *  <li>Add <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth2Manager">AFOAuth2Manager</a> to your project.  We recommend doing this with <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, but you should also be able to add the source files directly to your Xcode project.</li>
 *  <li>Try the following code in your app delegate:</li>
 * </ul>
 * \code
 *   #import <Rdio/Rdio.h>
 *   Rdio *rdio = [[Rdio alloc] initWithClientId:@"YOUR CLIENT_ID" andSecret:@"YOUR CLIENT_SECRET" delegate:nil];
 *   [rdio preparePlayerWithDelegate:nil];
 *   [rdio.player play:@"t2742133"];
 * \endcode
 *
 * Please direct feature requests and bug reports to
 * <a href="mailto:developersupport@rd.io">Developer Support</a>,
 * <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rdio-api">Rdio API Google Group</a>, or

 * If initialized before authenticating a user, the player will play 30 second samples.
 * If initialized after, the player will play tracks according to the user's subscription.
 * Authenticating a user after the player has been initialized will automatically
 * reinitialize the player so that it plays all subsequent tracks according to the user's subscription.
 *
 * Note that the automatic re-initialization will not promote a currently-playing (or paused) 30 second
 * sample to a full track, nor will it automatically trigger re-buffering of the track.
 * If it's desirable for your application to automatically restart the currently-playing sample as a full
 * track, you should call `stop` and replay the track manually to ensure that the full version is played.
 * If you don't do this, full track playback will begin at the next track.

/**
 * Fetches a playback token and initializes the Rdio player.
 * You'll need to call this method or preparePlayerWithDelegate in order to play music.
 * Using this method, the resulting player will respond to Rdio Remote Control events
 * and will share player state with other running instances of Rdio for the same authenticated user.
 *
 * If this method is called without an authenticated user, then the resulting player will be demoted to
 * an isolated player.  Due to the issues around interacting with a user's queue, the isolated player
 * will never automatically be promoted to share playstate upon login.
 *
 * To reiterate, in order to share playstate, you must explicitly call this method _after_ a user has
 * authenticated.
 *
 * If your app allows sample playback prior to authentication and also supports shared-playstate, we
 * recommend that you include the following calls in your `rdioDidAuthorizeUser:accessToken:` delegate
 * implementation:
 *
 * \code{.m}
 * Rdio *rdio = [YourRdioManager sharedRdioInstance];
 * [rdio.player stop];
 * [rdio.player.queue removeAll];
 * [rdio prepareSharedPlaystatePlayerWithDelegate:yourRdioDelegate];
 * \endcode
 *
 * As mentioned in the `removeAll` documentation, make sure that you call that method _before_ preparing
 * the shared-playstate player in order to clean up the local queue without wiping out the shared queue.
 *
 * The instance of RDPlayer returned by this method is also accessible via `rdio.player`.
 * @param delegate An object that implements the RDPlayerDelegate protocol, which will be set as the player's delegate.
